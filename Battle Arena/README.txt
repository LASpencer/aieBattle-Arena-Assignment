BattleArena by L. Andrew Spencer 2017

This program plays a JRPG style combat. Two teams of creatures battle each other, doing damage to
the members of the other team until all creatures on one team are killed, resulting in the other 
team winning.

I. Use
-------

This program uses the following keyboard controls
UP/DOWN		: Select through menu options
LEFT/RIGHT	: Select target creatures in battle
SPACEBAR	: Choose currently selected option
BACKSPACE	: Undo attack choice
ESCAPE		: Exit the game

The program begins in the main menu screen, with the options to play the game or quit. If you choose
to play, a battle starts. 

In a battle, the player's team is shown on the left side facing the enemy team on the right. The two 
teams are sorted by health, with the ones with most health at the front of their team. 
Each turn, you select the attack made by each member of your team, and if necessary the target of that 
attack. The creatures on the enemy team then make their attacks. For more details about the characters, 
monsters, attacks and combat system, see the player manual in the Docs folder.
After both teams have taken their turns, both teams are sorted by health, so the ones with most health 
are again at the front of their team. If the player's team is killed, they lose the game, and if the 
enemy team is killed, the player wins the game.
